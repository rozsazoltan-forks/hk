//! What each hk command does to the world.
//!
//! hk's usage spec is derived from Rust metadata, which has no way to express this,
//! so the classification lives here and is applied in [`crate::cli::usage`].
//!
//! The three values are defined by the usage spec:
//!
//! - `read` — only inspects state; running it twice is the same as running it
//!   once, and not running it changes nothing.
//! - `write` — creates or modifies state, but removes nothing the user cannot
//!   recreate.
//! - `destructive` — removes something the user installed or configured, where
//!   getting it back means redoing work. Deserves a confirmation prompt.
//!
//! **An unlisted command means "unknown", not "safe".** Consumers treat the
//! absence of a value as "ask", so leaving a command out is the conservative
//! choice and mislabeling one `read` is the dangerous one.
